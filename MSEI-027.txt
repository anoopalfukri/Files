Disaster management involves reducing preventable losses
1. Common Types of Cyber Crime
Cyber crime refers to any crime committed by the abuse of 
electronic media to influence the functioning of a computer 
system. Common types include: **Hacking: Unauthorized access 
to a computer network by bypassing security systems to copy, 
alter, or erase information. **Phishing: Sending messages fr
om false websites to trick the public into providing personal 
information like bank account numbers and login IDs.
Spam: The most common form, involving unsolicited bulk e-mails 
s*ent indiscriminately for commercial or malicious purposes.
*Cyber Terrorism: Using computer-based attacks to intimidate or 
coerce governments or organizations to advance political or 
social objectives. **Malware: This includes Viruses (self-repli
cating programs), Worms (independent programs that travel across 
networks), Trojan Horses (innocuous programs with hidden malici
ous code), and Logic Bombs (code triggered by specific events).
Software Piracy: The illegal duplication and distribution of 
copyrighted software.

Main Features of IT Act 2000
The Information Technology Act 2000 is the primary legislation 
in India dealing with cyber crimes. Legal Recognition: It provides 
legal recognition for transactions carried out via electronic 
data interchange and other means of electronic communication.
Jurisdiction: The Act addresses crimes that have no national 
boundaries, though it has certain limitations regarding interna
tional jurisdiction when servers are located outside the country. 
***Penalties for Source Code Tampering: Section 65 specifically 
addresses the intentional concealment, destruction, or alteration 
of computer source code when it is required maintained by law.

Characteristics of Banking & Financial Crime and Types
Financial or "White Collar" crimes are often more devastating to 
society's economic fabric than conventional crimes like robbery.
Characteristics: Perpetrators are typically well-educated, intelli
gent, and often in well-placed societal positions. The crimes are 
highly technical, complex, and often lack the social stigma 
attached to conventional crimes. Victims are often the whole 
society or large institutions rather than single individuals.
Types: External Frauds: Committed by persons not connected with 
the bank. Internal Frauds: Committed by bank staff or through 
collusion between staff and outsiders. Technological Frauds: 
Misappropriation of funds via manipulation of computer records, 
Net-banking frauds, and ATM/Credit card frauds.


Recent Economic Liberalisation and Enforcement Agencies
Economic liberalization has increased the opportunities for 
white-collar criminals, requiring stronger enforcement.
Challenges: The complexity of commercial activity and the 
international nature of financial transactions make investigation 
difficult. The secrecy of accounts in multi-national or foreign 
banks often hinders investigations. ***Enforcement Agencies:
CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation): The nodal agency in India 
for international cooperation via INTERPOL. DRI (Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence) and Directorate of Enforcement: Agencies 
critical for dealing with economic criminality and money laundering.
RBI (Reserve Bank of India): Issues educative advertisements 
regarding counterfeit currency and banking safety.

Types of Identity Thefts
Identity theft involves assuming another person's identity to access 
resources or obtain benefits in their name. ***Identity Cloning and
Concealment: Assuming another's identity to live as that person or 
to hide one's own identity. Criminal Identity Theft: Pretending to 
be someone else when apprehended by the police so the victim receives 
the criminal record. *** Synthetic Identity Theft: Creating a complete
ly new identity by combining real information (like a stolen Social 
Security number) with fake information. Medical Identity Theft: Using 
someone else's identity to obtain medical services or drugs

Types of Data Thefts and Source Code Theft and the Law
Data Theft: Often perpetrated by employees using USB drives, iPods, or 
digital cameras to steal confidential or copyrighted information before 
leaving a company. Source Code Theft: The theft or unauthorized 
alteration of the "computer source code" (the listing of programs/commands).
The Law: Under Section 65 of the IT Act 2000, tampering with computer 
source code is a punishable offense.


Types of Spam and Uses of Spam
Spam is the indiscriminate sending of unsolicited bulk messages. E-mail 
Spam: The most recognized form. Instant Messaging Spam (Spim): Targets 
IM systems. Mobile Phone Spam (SpaSMS): Directed at text messaging 
services, often incurring fees for the recipient. Other Media: Includes 
Wiki spam, Blog spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, and Social Networking spam.
Uses: Spam is used to spread viruses and Trojans, conduct phishing for 
identity theft, and facilitate "Advance Fee Frauds" (e.g., Nigerian Let
ter Fraud).

Types of Botnets and Preventive Measures
A botnet is a collection of "zombie" computers infected with malware and 
controlled by a "bot herder". Types of Botnet Activities: Denial of 
Service (DoS): Flooding a target network with traffic to crash it.
Spyware: Stealing passwords and credit card numbers from infected machines.
Click Fraud: Making a computer visit websites without the user's knowledge 
to generate false ad traffic. Preventive Measures: Users should avoid 
downloading suspicious e-mail attachments that may contain bot software.
Implementing firewalls and intrusion-detection systems. Regularly sanitizing 
redundant IT equipment before disposal to prevent data retrieval.

Applying Scientific Methods to Digital Forensics
The scientific method applied in digital forensics ensures 
that conclusions are based on facts rather than preconcei
ved notions. ***Digital Investigation and Evidence: Digit
al investigation answers questions about digital states 
and events (e.g., "does file X exist?"). Digital evidence 
is any digital object that supports or refutes a hypothesis 
regarding an offense. ***Digital Crime Scene Investigation 
Process: Similar to physical police work, this involves 
Preservation (making copies of memory and disks) and Surv
eying the scene for "obvious" evidence based on file types 
or keywords. ***General Guidelines: Key rules include 
minimizing handling of original data, logging all actions 
to maintain a chain of custody, and correlating data with 
independent sources to reduce the risk of forgery. 
***Data Analysis: Practitioners form a hypothesis, 
evaluate it through experiments (e.g., searching for expected 
artifacts), and draw conclusions to communicate to decision-
makers. ***Overview of Toolkits:SMART: Analyzes multiple file 
systems (NTFS, Ext2/3, etc.) and recovers deleted files. 
The Sleuth Kit (TSK) / Autopsy: A collection of command-line 
and graphical tools for file system analysis and timeline 
creation. create note for the below main heading and content

Collecting and Archiving
Methods of Collection: * Freezing the Scene: Taking a snapshot 
of the system in its compromised state. Honeypotting: Creating 
a replica system to lure and monitor an attacker. Artifacts: 
Digital evidence must be Authentic (from where you say it is), 
Reliable (procedures didn't cast doubt), and Believable to a 
jury.Collection Steps: Involves notifying authorities, collec
ting data onto removable non-volatile media, and creating 
cryptographic message digests (hashes) for verification.

Data Acquisition

Why Collect Evidence? The two primary reasons are Future 
Prevention (fixing the "lock") and Responsibility (holding 
attackers accountable). Collection Options: Includes logical 
data acquisition (using high-level protocols without raw 
memory access) and disc imaging. Obstacles: High costs of 
collection, system downtime, and the potential for perpetr
ators to delete logs or evidence before they are secured.
Rules of Evidence: Evidence should be Admissible, Authentic, 
Complete, Reliable, and Believable. Volatile Evidence: Data 
that is lost when power is removed. It must be collected in 
a specific Order of Volatility, starting from registers and 
cache, then routing tables, ARP cache, process tables, and 
finally main memory.

Data Recovery

Salvaging Deleted Data: Converting unreadable or hidden data 
into a readable form. Deleted Files and Folders vs. File 
Carving: * File Recovery: Uses remaining file system 
information (like metadata) to restore files.
File Carving: Works with raw data and internal file structures 
(e.g., JPEG headers) without relying on the file system.
Handling Special Files: Includes extracting embedded metadata 
(data about data) and analyzing specific file storage media and 
systems like FAT32 or NTFS.


Log File Analysis

Timestamps: Used to determine the temporal (time) order of events 
across different log files, though they can be complicated by 
clock drift or tampering. File System Analysis: Detecting deleted 
files and analyzing file attributes to reconstruct events.
Reconstruction: Involves restoring directories from backups or 
analyzing how exploits were compiled, run, and subsequently deleted 
by an attacker. Moving/Deleting Files: Detecting changes in file 
locations or attributes that indicate unauthorized activity.

Firewall Security Systems
Need and Benefits: Firewalls control access to protected networks, 
serving as an auditor that logs traffic, compiles statistics, and 
blocks insecure services. Why They Aren't Enough: They cannot 
protect against attacks that bypass them (e.g., via a modem or 
internal breach) or against authorized services that are exploited.
Controlled Access/Concentrated Security: Firewalls provide a single 
"choke point" where security policies and audits can be strictly imposed.

Routers and Switches

Routers: Often used by hackers for reconnaissance to map an internal 
network. Common Attacks: Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP, unauthorized 
Telnet connections, and SNMP exploits to gain configuration data.
Collection Procedure: Requires sound, repeatable practices to collect 
both volatile data (like routing tables) and non-volatile data 
(configuration files) for court.
Switches: * Concepts and Advantages: Switches are superior to hubs 
because they manage traffic more efficiently and can isolate network 
segments. Data Collection: Procedures involve capturing core dumps and 
using audit tools to evaluate security configurations

1. Extracting Data from Mobile Phones
Mobile forensic data extraction involves recovering digital evidence 
from mobile devices under forensically sound conditions. The process 
must ensure that no actions performed by investigators change the data 
on the original device.**SIM Cards:Data can be extracted from SIM cards 
using a specialized smart card reader. A forensically acceptable extra
ction can be achieved by directly analyzing the SIM contents through a 
reader and using terminal programs to send standardized commands (e.g.,
 ETSI 'TS 31.101'). ***Phone Memory: Extraction from phone memory is more 
complex and often involves specialized software toolkits. Some tools use 
a "Software Agent" installed on the phone to create a memory dump of 
specific files, while others use protocols like OBEX or FBUS to extract 
media files and phonebook entries.


Data Stored in Mobile Phones
Data on a mobile phone can be found in three primary locations: the SIM 
card, the phone's internal memory, and the service provider's records.
Data Stored in SIM Card: Typically includes the International Mobile 
Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Integrated Circuit Card Identifier (ICCID), 
Abbreviated Dialing Numbers (ADN), Last Numbers Dialed (LND), and SMS 
messages. Data Stored in Phone Memory: Modern phones have large onboard 
memory (e.g., 80MB or more) storing calendar information, call log entries, 
ring tones, audio/video recordings, images, and application executables.
Data Stored by the Service Provider: This includes subscriber identification, 
call charging information, services obtained, and call routing data

Call Detail Record (CDR)
CDR and Carrier Data: A Call Detail Record (CDR) is an evidence 
cornerstone containing information used by network operators for 
subscriber identification and billing.
Evidence Cornerstone: CDR analysis involves the retrieval of all 
forms of data stored on the mobile device, including call log recovery, 
text message recovery, and call pattern analysis.
Carrier Data Challenges: The relationship between carrier data and the 
device is crucial for forensic analysis, including the forensic analysis 
of billing records and mobile phone downloads.

Application of SIM Card Reader's
SIM card readers allow examiners to acquire data directly from the SIM 
using PC/SC-compatible readers. SIM Card Acquisition: Tools like TULP2G 
allow examiners to acquire data fields such as Abbreviated Dialing Numbers 
and SMS messages using a compatible protocol plug-in. ***Synopsis of 
SIMIS: Version 2.0.13 can acquire a wide range of data, including IMSI, 
MSISDN, and location information. It provides a user interface for 
creating report notes and searching acquired data.
Synopsis of ForensicSIM: This toolkit from Radio Tactics requires using 
an acquisition terminal to create duplicate copies (Master, Prosecution, 
and Defense SIMs) before analysis. It also offers an "Access Card" to 
examine a handset without connecting to the cellular network.
***Synopsis of Forensic Card Reader: Forensic SIM tools extract digital 
evidence present in the hierarchical file system of a SIM, starting from 
the Master File (MF). ***Synopsis of SIMCon: SIMCon is one of several 
forensic tools (alongside Cell Seizure and .XRY) evaluated for its ability 
to recover standardized SIM data like the IMSI and ICCID.


Unit 4

1. Classification of Wireless Network
Wireless networks are classified by the Institute for Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) based on their range, speed, and purpose.
WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks): These network a small community 
of users, such as a campus, where medium range is required.
802.11: The base set of standards designed for wireless Ethernet LANs.
802.11b Wi-Fi: Operates at 2.4GHz with data rates up to 11 Mbps; range 
is approximately 100m indoors and 500m outdoors.
802.11a Wi-Fi: Operates at 5GHz with higher data rates up to 54 Mbps 
but a shorter range of 20-30m. 802.11g: A versatile standard that offers 
the high speed of 802.11a (54 Mbps) at the longer range of 802.11b.
802.11n: Designed for much higher throughput, claiming speeds between 
100 - 240 Mbps. WMANs (Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks): Used to 
network city-sized areas (up to a 50 km radius) for public safety 
agencies like fire and police. 802.16 WiMax: Supports data rates up 
to 120 Mbps with a range up to 30 miles. 802.20: A standard designed 
for mobile broadband wireless access. WPANs (Wireless Personal Area 
Networks): Used for short-range multimedia communications, typically up to 10m.
802.15.1 Bluetooth 1: The standard for short-range wireless connectivity.
802.15.3 Wimedia: Designed for high-rate WPANs. 802.15.4 Zigbee: Used for 
small-scale projects requiring data transfer over short distances with low 
power consumption.


Wireless Security Best Practices
To protect wireless networks, organizations should apply technical and 
operational controls. MAC ID Filtering: Every Network Interface Card (NIC) 
has a unique MAC address. Access points can be configured to allow only 
specific, authorized MAC IDs. However, this is easily bypassed by "MAC 
spoofing" where a hacker uses "sniffing" software to detect and then 
mimic an authorized address. Static IP Addressing: Assigning fixed IP 
addresses rather than using DHCP can add a minor layer of complexity 
for casual intruders. *** WLANs 802.11 Security: Encryption: Because 
radio signals leak outside buildings, encryption is essential. 
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is considered weak and easily cracked; 
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 (802.11i) are more secure 
alternatives. AP Configuration: Change default administrator passwords 
immediately. Disable "remote administration" unless absolutely necessary.
Signal Management: Place access points away from exterior walls and reduce 
transmitter power to limit the signal's reach outside the premises.

The Ethical Hacking Process
Ethical hacking, or penetration testing, involves using the same tools 
and techniques as malicious hackers but with the target's permission 
to discover and fix vulnerabilities. ***Formulating the Plan: This 
initial stage involves defining the scope of the test. Ethical hackers 
work with the organization to understand what assets need protection 
and what the boundaries for the assessment will be. ***Selecting Tools: 
Teams are assembled based on expertise (e.g., routers, Linux, firewalls)
.They select appropriate tools for the specific environment, such as 
"sniffers" for wireless traffic or tools to probe entry points.
***Executing the Plan: This phase involves active testing. It may start 
with "Reconnaissance" to identify system information, followed by posing 
as a normal user to evaluate security measures (like WEP strength), and 
finally attempting to exploit discovered vulnerabilities to access other 
network segments. ***Evaluating Results: The findings are compiled into 
a comprehensive, traceable report. This report includes results, conclus
ions, and recommendations ranked by risk and probability.
Moving On: Because new vulnerabilities appear regularly, security tests 
are only a "snapshot" of a system's posture. Organizations must plan for 
regular, ongoing testing to maintain security as systems change or are upgraded
